There are two types of connections: \"target\" and \"expression\".\n\nFor a \"target\" connection, you can drag a signal from the list onto its receiver. In the dialog, you can choose a method to invoke or execute arbitrary code. You can write Godot expressions that can access the \"from\" and \"to\" nodes.\n\nFor an \"expression\" connection, you can double-click a signal in the list to create an expression connection. This allows you to execute arbitrary Godot code without a receiver node. You can access the \"from\" node in the code."
