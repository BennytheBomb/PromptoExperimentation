The AI provides a comprehensive list of questions, covering various aspects of the framework, its features, limitations, and usage. The questions cover topics such as accessing the Pronto framework, troubleshooting issues, using external assets, creating prototypes, customizing behaviors, managing game state, collaborating with other developers, optimizing performance, integrating external libraries, organizing code, exporting to different platforms, testing within the framework, and known issues or bugs. The AI also mentions that the accuracy and availability of answers may vary depending on the specific chatbot's knowledge and capabilities. The human asks how to connect two behaviors, and the AI explains that it can be done using the framework's wiring system.\")], 'answer': 'To use the wiring system, you need to follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Identify the behaviors or mechanics that you want to connect or wire together.\\n\\n2. Determine the type of connection you need. There are two types: primary connections and prepared connections.\\n\\n3. For primary connections, you will need to manually assemble your game by wiring the behaviors together. This involves connecting the input and output signals of the behaviors using the wiring system.\\n\\n4. For prepared connections, some connections have already been created for you to use. You can select and use these pre-made connections instead of manually wiring the behaviors.\\n\\n5. When choosing a mechanic to connect, consider whether it would be more efficient to build a paper prototype first. This can help you test and iterate on your ideas before implementing them in the game.\\n\\n6. If you need to reload or refresh any connections, you can access them from within the code.\\n\\n7. Additionally, you may need to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the wiring process. This can involve adjusting signal levels, renaming signals, or using logical OR-gating of signals.\\n\\nRemember, if you have any specific questions or need further assistance with the wiring system, feel free to ask.'}\n"
